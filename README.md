ONETAP - Your Quick Link to Safety and Support
Project Title:

ONETAP – Streamlining Emergency and Non-Emergency Services

Team Details:

Team Name: BOSS BABIES
College: College of Engineering, Guindy
Domain: Public Welfare
Problem Statement
Citizens face significant challenges in reporting non-emergency issues like malfunctioning streetlights or unattended garbage due to a lack of awareness and inefficient communication channels with authorities. For emergencies, intermediaries often delay critical responses, leading to ineffective ambulance dispatch or fire engine allocation. These inefficiencies result in safety risks and urban decay.

Proposed Solution
Emergency Handling:

Ambulance Services:
Direct dispatch of ambulances without intermediaries.
Users register details of trusted neighbors for emergency assistance.
Features two modes:
Default Mode: Initiates ambulance dispatch with video calls and notifications to neighbors/family.
Helper Mode: Notifies family members and dispatches ambulances without video calls.
Fire Engine & Police Services:
Voice-activated or manually selected emergency options.
Dispatches resources directly to the location and connects users with officials for real-time guidance.
Sends automated notifications to neighbors/family.
Non-Emergency Handling:

Simplifies reporting of civic issues with photos and captions.
Uses ML-based NLP to parse and categorize issues, directing them to the appropriate authority.
Tracks and escalates unresolved issues to higher officials for accountability.
Rewards civic engagement with redeemable credits.
Target Market
Urban and suburban regions with high population densities.
Local governments, healthcare facilities, and community organizations.
Business Model
Partnerships with emergency responders and local municipalities.
Enhanced transparency and accountability through case-tracking mechanisms.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React Native
Backend: Django, MongoDB for scalability
Machine Learning:
Batch Matching Algorithms: Combining Spatial Indexing (GeoPandas) and KNN for nearest dispatches.
NLP: Parsing captions with SVM/Naïve Bayes/Logistic Regression.
Image Classification: Fine-tuned CNN models in TensorFlow.
Novelty
Eliminates intermediaries for faster emergency response.
Integrates ML for efficient issue classification and resource allocation.
Promotes civic engagement with a credit-based reward system.
Enhances transparency in reporting and resolution.
How It Works
Emergency Services:
One-tap solutions for ambulance, police, and fire engine dispatches.
Automated communication with family and neighbors for coordinated responses.
Non-Emergency Reporting:
Easy-to-use interface for reporting issues.
Tracks, escalates, and rewards resolution efforts.
Impact
ONETAP ensures faster, more reliable emergency services and empowers citizens to improve their communities, fostering a safer, more engaged society.
